# Sequent

Here I implement a compile-time proof procedure for classical propositional logic with C++17 templates. It is a simple automated theorem prover that determines the validity of logical arguments expressed as [sequents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent) using [semantic tableaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux).

This chapter is a must-read for anyone with an interest in formal logic. It assumes minimal background knowledge and does an amazing job at presenting the philosophical and mathematical insights of the field. It also covers important moments in the history of logic and the development of modern logic. This provides context to the subject and grounds it in the debates that drove its development over the centuries. To me, it struck the perfect balance between precision and accessibility.
